# 🚀 AI/ML Job Market Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📊 **Project Overview**
**This project analyzes a dataset of 2,000 AI and machine learning job postings from 2023 to 2025** across multiple industries and geographic locations. The goal is to uncover hiring trends, salary patterns, and the most in-demand skills shaping the AI/ML job market.

## 💾 **Dataset**
**The dataset contains:**
- Job titles, industries, employment types
- Company sizes, experience levels, salary ranges
- Locations, required technical skills, preferred tools

**Provides a comprehensive view of the evolving AI/ML recruitment landscape.**

## 🔍 **Analysis**
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** with Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Exploratory visualizations** using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
  - Pie charts, bar charts, boxplots
  - Time-series plots for hiring trends
- **Insights into** top job titles, salary distributions, skill demand
- **Temporal analysis** of job posting trends
